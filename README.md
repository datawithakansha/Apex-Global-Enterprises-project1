1.🚀 Project Completed: Finance Expense Analysis Dashboard (Excel)
I’ve recently completed an end-to-end Data Analyst project using Microsoft Excel, focused on analyzing a company’s financial expenses to uncover key business insights and help management make data-driven decisions.

2.🔍 Project Overview
In this project, I worked on a realistic finance dataset and created an interactive Excel dashboard that visualizes expense patterns across departments, vendors, and time periods.

3.📊 Key Analyses Performed
✔️ Total Annual Expenses & Department-wise Spending
✔️ Monthly and Quarterly Expense Trends
✔️ Top 5 Vendors by Total Expense
✔️ Average Expense per Department
✔️ Category-wise Expense Contribution
✔️ Month-over-Month Expense Growth
✔️ Payment Method Utilization
✔️ Year-to-Date Expense Tracking

4.💡 Key Insights
📈 Marketing and Operations departments accounted for the highest spending.
📅 March and August showed unexpected expense spikes — potential overspending alerts.
🏢 Vendor dependency was high (Top 2 vendors covered ~45% of total spend).
💳 Online payments dominated over cash, ensuring smoother financial tracking.

5.🧠 Tools & Techniques Used
Excel Formulas: SUMIFS, AVERAGEIF, LARGE, % Contribution, Month-over-Month Change
Pivot Tables & Charts (Line, Bar, Pie)
KPI Cards and Slicers for interactive filtering

6.💬 Outcome:
This dashboard helps the finance manager easily monitor budget performance, identify overspending areas, and plan future budgets efficiently.
